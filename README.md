# Boggle Game Solver
Developed a Boggle game solver to identify all valid words (3+ letters) on a 2D letter board, adhering to adjacency rules (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) and tile reuse constraints. </br>
Key contributions:</br>

- Implemented depth-first search (DFS) with backtracking to explore 8-directional paths, ensuring tiles are used only once per word.</br>

- Integrated a trie data structure for efficient dictionary storage and prefix validation, reducing redundant searches.</br>

- Designed logic to handle edge cases, including minimum word length enforcement and dynamic board configurations.</br>

- Validated solution accuracy by testing against diverse boards and dictionary inputs.
